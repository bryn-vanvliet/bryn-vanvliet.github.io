    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long term career goal is to obtain a remote software development job
      ideally in the arts field. More specifically, I would like to work for a
      software company that provides programs to musicians like myself. For
      example; Sibelius, Serrato, Rekordbox etc. I feel that my experience as a
      musician would be helpful in that context. I would also like to build apps
      as a potential passive income stream.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What are my biggest strengths and limitations going to be at Bootcamp?
    </h3>
    <p>Problem solving and rememebering syntax</p>
    <h3>What will be my biggest non-techincal challenge at bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      Remaining motivated through challening times. Keeping up with the
      coursework.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would I like to see developed
      in myself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'd like to improve my self-awareness. Specifically in terms of managing
      feelings of overwhelm. Currently, I don't realise i'm experiencing great
      overwhelm until it's too late.
    </p>
    <h3>What are my expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>
      To be patient and helpful. I'd like the team to help me to find my own
      answers through guidance if I am stuck. That way I can navigate my
      learning better.
    </p>
    <h3>My expectations of myself and my commitment</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I will manage myself by developing and adhering to my personal study
          routine. Currently that involves a mix of set starting times for the
          day, exercise and mental health breaks.
        </li>
        <li>
          When experiencing overwhelm, i will take my foot of the gas temporarily,
          step back and perhaps do an activity that takes my attention and energy
          off the task. I will also reach out to my facilitator and cohort.
        </li>
        <li>
          When needing help, i will first use the resources supplied by Dev
          Academy, information on the internet and chat gbt. And also my
          facilitator and cohort. I fortunately have friends who have done the
          course recently too, so can also reach out to them for some more help.
        </li>
        <li>
          From the facilitators i expect timely responses and quality advice to
          resolve problems efficiently. I also hope that the facilitators will
          help me to resolve problems by guiding me to figure out the answers
          myself.
        </li>
        <li>
          With navigating other commitments around this course, i’m still active
          as a musicians, so scheduling practice time in is super helpful to keep
          my software developer brain fresh. I also have exercise times blocked
          out each day. I will aim to keep weekends free, unless I need to catch
          up.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
  

      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      With learning, my strengths are that I am persistent and dedicated. I’m
      good with patterns and formulas and memorizing. However, I get overwhelmed
      sometimes and I make silly decisions and dig myself a hole in the pursuit
      of urgently trying to fix a problem.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>More rational thinking and stress management.</p>
