    <h2>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is in control of how a website reacts to actions. For example,
      if you order something on amazon, javascript will take your order and
      process it and also will update the stock of that order on the sellers
      side too.
