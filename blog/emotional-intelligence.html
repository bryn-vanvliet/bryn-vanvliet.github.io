    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is a core personal value. Many of the trials and
      tribulations of life can navigated with greater ease by developing &
      practicing emotional intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is our <span class="response">response</span> to
      emotions that arise. Strong emotions such as; anger, grief, anxiety can be
      debilitating, but we have a choose on how we are going to cognitively
      respond to these emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when I feel the frustration arise whilst i'm trying to make
      this blog function well (a good example), realising that I have a choice
      in how I respond to this emotion makes me feel empowered and in control.

      In Stephen R. Covey's book titled
      <span class="habits-title"
        >"The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People"</span
      >
      he discusses the idea of "reactive" & "pro-active" responses. Consider
      this situation, you're driving down the road and cyclist smashes into your
      car. They are extremely mad because they think it's your fault. They are
      yelling at you and calling you names. A "reactive" response to this
      situation would be to get angry back, yell, scream, possibly get into a
      fight. A "pro-active" response might be to let this person experience the
      feelings that are happening, wait for them to calm down. Then through
      logic, patience and understanding, figure out how to solve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reactive response only adds fuel to the fire. Whislt, a pro-active
      response resolves the problem quicker and easier whislt conserving your
      personal energy.
