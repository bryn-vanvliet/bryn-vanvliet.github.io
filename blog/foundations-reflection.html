    <h2>My Reflections</h2>
    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’m anxious about finding answers to problems as soon as possible. And if
      it doesn’t happen, I start to feel like I’m not smart enough.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I feel like these roles particularly apply to your view of yourself. It’s
      about discovering the best way that you learn, and creating a healthy
      environment for your learning. Self-awareness to know your limits and
      habits. Empathy to yourself and others while struggling with tasks. And
      creating positive values to reflect you as a person, and to create a
      healthy working environment for yourself or your team.
    </p>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The fixed & growth mindset/Neuroplasticity learnings. I thought I knew
      what category I fell into but the internal findings were surprising to me.
      I realized that I had been in a fixed mindset for particular things
      regarding this course.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Honestly the most challenging this was trying to put aside quality time to
      engage with this material. I’ve had a lot of anxiety about falling behind
      in this course so at the beginning I didn’t spend probably enough time on
      this part of the course, and instead focused on the tech. But around
      sprint 3 I realized that it’s actually so crucial to learning, and
      particularly in this course.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because there is an unbelievable amount of learning taking place in a
      short period of time. If the mind isn’t in a functional state and unable
      to take in a process new information, it would be significantly more
      challenging than normal.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Initially I wanted to spend more time on the tech, but now I prioritize
      the Human Skills. It’s an extremely valuable resource to have.
