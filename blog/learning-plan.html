    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      My long term career goal is to obtain a remote software development job
      ideally in the arts field. More specifically, I would like to work for a
      software company that provides programs to musicians like myself. For
      example; Sibelius, Serrato, Rekordbox etc. I feel that my experience as a
      musician would be helpful in that context. I would also like to build apps
      as a potential passive income stream.
    </p>
    <h2>
      >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
      With learning, my strengths are that I am persistent and dedicated. I’m
      good with patterns and formulas and memorizing. However, I get overwhelmed
      sometimes and I make silly decisions and dig myself a hole in the pursuit
      of urgently trying to fix a problem.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>More rational thinking and stress management.</p>
    <h2>My Commitment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I will manage myself by developing and adhering to my personal study
        routine. Currently that involves a mix of set starting times for the
        day, exercise and mental health breaks.
      </li>
      <li>
        When experiencing overwhelm, i will take my foot of the gas temporarily,
        step back and perhaps do an activity that takes my attention and energy
        off the task. I will also reach out to my facilitator and cohort.
      </li>
      <li>
        When needing help, i will first use the resources supplied by Dev
        Academy, information on the internet and chat gbt. And also my
        facilitator and cohort. I fortunately have friends who have done the
        course recently too, so can also reach out to them for some more help.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the facilitators i expect timely responses and quality advice to
        resolve problems efficiently. I also hope that the facilitators will
        help me to resolve problems by guiding me to figure out the answers
        myself.
      </li>
      <li>
        With navigating other commitments around this course, i’m still active
        as a musicians, so scheduling practice time in is super helpful to keep
        my software developer brain fresh. I also have exercise times blocked
        out each day. I will aim to keep weekends free, unless I need to catch
        up.
      </li>
    </ul>
