    <h2>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is in control of how a website reacts to actions. For example,
      if you order something on amazon, javascript will take your order and
      process it and also will update the stock of that order on the sellers
      side too.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life
    </h2>
    <p>
      Code is run from the top of the line to the bottom. Unless it runs into a
      conditional like a for or if loop. A loop is way to run information
      through a loop that can add or substract a sum onto the total. It's
      counting the number of laps and athlete running around the track does. You
      could also add say everytime they make a lap and start again, they get
      another drink bottle. You can use this reverse too.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The DOM = Document Object Model, is a way of accessing files in the html
      from your javascript. Here you can access elements by id's, classes and
      more and change things within it. You use this in conjuction with
      functions to return specific results. For example, if you run out of stock
      on the object - turn the text red. It's crucial with responsive web
      design.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accessing data from arrays means that you are accessing potentially
      multiple pieces of information. While accessing data from objects requires
      you to use a named key to retrieve a specifc value. Arrays are best for
      ordered list (names) and objects are better for representing names
      properties of single entity. (products on a menu)
    </p>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are essentially a list of instructions. First you declare the
      function i.e name it. Then you give the parameters arguments if necessary,
      then write out the instrunctions. I think of functions as a meal, and the
      instructions are the ingredients and parameters might be the dietary
      requirements of the person eating it, or the number of people. When you
      call the function (activate it), it's like you are serving the meal.
