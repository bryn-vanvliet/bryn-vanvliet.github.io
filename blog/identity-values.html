    <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision</h2>
    <p>
      I was an educator a top NZ tertiary institute for 4 years. I decided to
      leave this role at the end of last year as my values as an educator were
      not being met by the way the institute handled their curriculum,
      communication and treatment of staff. When I started this role, I told
      myself that I would not continue working here if I became bitter or sour
      to my job, as it’s important for me that students learning experience
      remain untouched by the inner workings of a university. The students
      learning became compromised, and over a long period of time I noticed
      nothing was changing. So I made the ethical decision to leave this
      position (which was the best education job I could get in my field), for
      my own creative, professional and spiritual integrity.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I’m deeply influenced by the arts scene in Wellington. I have been
      surrounded by passionate, generous and motivated musicians since moving to
      Wellington 14 years ago. This environment has created a habit in me to
      keep working towards my goals, because the music industry is brutal, it’s
      easy to “fall out” of the scene. In the same respect, it’s inspired me to
      follow my own creative voice so I could pursue my own identity. My belief
      is that whether you like it or not, your creative identity is a reflection
      of your personal identity.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of my biggest strengths is my perseverance. Once I begin a task, I
      must complete it at all costs, it’s almost like a compulsion. Which
      fortunately, means that I suit being in an academic environment. I also
      like to believe that I hold great empathy and fairness for others and am
      happy and even excited to assist others when/where possible.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I get overwhelmed with lots of new information in short periods of time.
      This along with some sensory overload is a bit of a limitation. However
      I’m acutely aware of these things and currently am good at managing this
      behavior. 3 5 Share an example of when you were trying to work
      productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
      strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your
      reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why. I have
      done a lot of collective songwriting with others. There have been many
      instances of tension and resistance within a group framework especially
      when we were younger and had a bit more unregulated testosterone. One
      instance was when we had external songwriters working with us, and I
      personally did not feel good about the direction the music was headed. At
      first I tried patience and understanding and picked my moments to
      contribute wisely. I tried this multiple times but my ideas were seemingly
      rejected without even trying them out. When this happened over and over
      again over the space of a few hours, I decided that I simply wasn’t on the
      same wavelength as the others and removed myself from the writing session
      and subsequent sessions on that project. On reflection, I wish I had
      communicated with my band members in a safe space to share my feelings.
      Because maybe they were feeling the same, but instead I chose the path of
      self-preservation.
