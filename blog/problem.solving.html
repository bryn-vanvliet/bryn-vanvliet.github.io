    <h2>DISCUSS</h2>
    <p><strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What was the problem? The problem was not understaing specific elements
        of javascript from sprint 3.
      </li>

      <li>
        What problem-solving techniques did you use? I returned to sprint 3 and
        re-did about half of the sprint. I also used pseudocode and tried some
        things out.
      </li>
      <li>
        How did you feel throughout the process? Quite frustrated throughout.
        Feelings of inadequacy crept in too.
      </li>
      <li>
        What did you learn? That I needed to change the way I learn. I was
        approaching Dev Academy from a stress and fixed mindset. This week i've
        tried really hard to approach the content from a relaxed and growth
        mindset. Allowing myself to be bad at this while I learn it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>What was the problem? Finding the average in a sum of numbers</li>
      <li>
        What problem-solving techniques did you use? Mostly research on the
        internet. Also consulted a friend who guided me.
      </li>
      <li>How did you feel throughout the process? Frustrated</li>
      <li>
        What did you learn? About syntax writing and that sum / arr.length
        returns the average (in this case)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
        problem-solving techniques/processes:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pseudocode - I'm working on how I write my thoughts. I'm still not quite
        writing the write prompts to formulate a logical answer but it's
        improving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trying something - I felt more confident just giving things a go. Using
        console.log to understand what the current output is and using that to
        help my code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rubber ducky method - This one is still a bit strange to me. I like to
        just talk out loud to myself and that seems to help. Treating myself as
        the rubber ducky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading error messages - Not great. But understanding a little more
        because I saw many of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Console.logging - Improving! I relied on this alot during this sprint.
      </li>
      <li>Googling - Getting pretty good at this. I googled ALOT.</li>
      <li>
        Asking your peers for help - Improving at this too, and trying to not
        feel like i'm bothering others with my questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Asking coaches for help - I found that I reached out for help, but then
        in the space between sending the message and hearing back, I found the
        answer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improving your process with reflection - I guess i'm being more honest
        with myself in thes reflections. Transparently saying what my experience
        has been.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      4.
      <span
        >Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
        made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
        time?</span
      >
      Earlier this week I felt reluctant to ask for help, because I wanted the
      satisfaction of completing things on my own. I'm still not quite there
      yet, but I will be. Next time I will use the pomodoro timer more often and
      set myself a time limit of solving problems. If I havn't solved it in the
      time, I will reach out for help. That way I won't get stuck as much.
