    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding essentially how your brain learns and retains information is
      a key component to learning, and especially learning something new. There
      is a proven method of learning that utilizes the A.G.E.S method. Attention
      - In order to learn you need to pay attention and to not have
      distractions. Generation - Relating the new information to something they
      have already learned. Creating a meaningful connection and generation of
      new ideas. Emotion - Assign an emotion to the learning. This is more
      likely to remember the content. Also makes it fun or extra challenging?
      Spacing - Spacing out the learning makes it more manageable. Perhaps what
      you learn and the intervals you do it in is what this means.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
      your benefit.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Removing distractions whilst studying, glad to say I have been working on
      this lately. Fortunately relating new information to pre-existing things I
      understand is a method I have been using to learn languages. For example,
      using my knowledge of Portuguese to help learn Spanish, as they are
      similar. A little unclear how emotion works into this, but I think making
      the learning fun and engaging is helpful. I could treat the tasks as games
      instead of this untangible thing. Spacing - I need to have more spacing in
      my learning, as I try to learn everything in a rush, and don’t retain it.
    </p>
    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      Apply the A.G.E.S principles. In particular the spacing, I think that is a
      crucial component I am missing. ◦ Link to a resource that you found
      particularly useful or engaging.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      Growth mindset is essentially how you view yourself learning, your frame
      of mind, your attitude towards learning. Growth mindset is relevant
      because understanding what constitutes a growth mindset plays a big role
      in the development of new skills. Currently I am learning a whole new
      skill from scratch and am dealing with multitudes of information
      constantly, which is overwhelming. Understanding what mindset I’m in and
      moving towards adopting the growth mindset more consistently I think will
      yield more positive results.
    </p>
    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>
      I noticed myself reflecting on what mindset I’m currently in. I noticed
      traits of a fixed mindset which was alarming to me, as I normally feel
      like I embrace challenges and am always striving to be better.
    </p>
    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>
      By recognizing what constitutes a fixed mindset, and noticing when I fall
      into those behaviors.
    </p>
    <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
    <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
    <p>
      These learnings can be implemented into my learning strategy as a high
      priority. I understand that without a growth mindset, embarking on this
      journey is going to be significantly harder. The mind and spirit must be
      in good condition in order to be successful, in this case with intensive
      study.
